      Meaning of “acting with agency”

To say someone acts with agency means they are initiating actions based on their own intentions rather than simply reacting to external forces. The core idea is self-directed, goal-oriented action.

Key components — reasoning steps
	1.	Intentionality
They form their own aims instead of being pushed along by circumstance.
	2.	Autonomy
They choose among alternatives without coercion. Even if constraints exist, they retain some freedom of choice.
	3.	Competence / efficacy
They can take actions that actually influence outcomes; they aren’t merely symbolic participants.
	4.	Ownership of decisions
They see themselves as the source of their actions and are accountable for them.

Example to anchor it
	•	A person who designs a plan, adjusts it as conditions change, and follows through—even under pressure—is acting with agency.
	•	Someone who only follows instructions or defaults to habit without considering alternatives is acting with reduced agency.
